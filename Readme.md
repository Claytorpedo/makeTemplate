# MakefileTemplate

This is a template Makefile to make setting up my future projects easier. It has a lot of comments so I don't have to remember details.  
I haven't tested all combinations of settings, so use at your own risk.

## Functionality

Currently handles:  
- Directory structurs with multiple directories/levels.
- Support for submodules using their own makefiles.
- Object and header dependencies
- Outputting executables or static or shared libraries.
- A help function to list options.
